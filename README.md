# Spell It Out

This is a React Native application.

You can find a running version of the application here: http://spellitout.net/

This was a project I built after learning the basics of React Native. I utilized the Oxford dictionary API to generate examples and definitions for the words and stored them as JSON. I am hosting the application on a Digital Ocean server.

## Things I would do differently

I used React Native because the idea of a single codebase for iOS, Android and Webapps sounded amazing. For this project I decided to only go with a Web Application because I wanted to start working more with servers.
